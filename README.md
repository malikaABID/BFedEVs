Decentralized Anomaly Detection in Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment via Federated Learning and Blockchain Integration
#  Abstract
In the electric vehicle life cycle, the security of electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) is becoming increasingly important due to the increasing number of cyber threats that are directed at the charging infrastructure. This paper presents a comprehensive architecture for securing and ensuring privacy in EVSE systems, with a focus on the CIC-EVSE-2024 dataset. Data preprocessing, centralized learning, federated learning, and blockchain-enhanced federated learning are the four main stages of the methodology. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) were used to improve the quality of the data during preprocessing. During the centralized learning phase, various machine learning models, including a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture, were then trained and evaluated to determine their suitability for anomaly detection. The federated learning setup was therefore constructed in such a way as to ensure data privacy while granting decentralized model training across clients with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. Blockchain integration makes for a secure platform to record model updates, ensuring integrity and accountability. The results from the experiment showed a remarkable enhancement in the performance of the classification, thus proving that integrating advanced machine learning technologies with blockchain is a viable approach in handling cybersecurity challenges in EVSE systems. This framework provides a scalable, privacy-aware solution for future EVSE infrastructures.
